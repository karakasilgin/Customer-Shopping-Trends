# Customer-Shopping-Trends

As can be seen above, we have the results of the data and visualizations. If we look at this table , the majority of payments are made every 3 months and payments are made by credit card. Of course, a pie chat could be used here, it would be healthier to see the percentage. The majority of sales are made to men and even sales to women are half as much as made to men. When we look at location based sales, we see the each city has very different sales amounts, but the largest sales are made in Montana.
